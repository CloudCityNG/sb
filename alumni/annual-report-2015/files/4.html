		<div id="page_text" class="content">highlights Through both time-honored traditions and new programs that evolved to meet the interests of our alumni today, the many highlights of this past year captured the spirit of Stony Brook University and the essence of what makes us all proud to be Stony Brook alumni. Alumni panelist, Julie Vinod ’10, ’15 presents at Converging Sciences Summit on “Community Engagement and Population Health.” Wolfstock, a Homecoming Tradition Health Sciences Center Alumni Thank you to the more than 1,800 alumni and friends who attended our 2014 Wolfstock Homecoming festivities, including – both new traditions and old – campus tours, faculty lectures, mini-reunions and a large BBQ tailgate with fun for the whole family. Afterward a record-setting crowd of 11,301 packed the stands at LaValle Stadium, and the stadium shook with excitement as fans cheered the Seawolves all the way into overtime during their match-up against the William and Mary Tribe. The festivities concluded with a thrilling fireworks display, making it a Homecoming to remember for all who came back to the Brook. Graduates from the five Health Sciences Center (HSC) Schools have been actively assisting nursing, medical, dental, social welfare and allied health students, including new mentoring programs to help nursing and medical students transition to their new professions. Many HSC graduates have been attending class and program reunions, and several class and family endowments have been established. On April 27, 2015, the Alumni Relations Office collaborated with all of the HSC schools to host the Converging Sciences Summit, a one day symposium on global community health issues (more than 60 alumni took part as speakers and attendees!) Alumni Career Services (A partnership with the Career Center funded in part by the Association) Our new Senior Career Consultant for Alumni, Nikki Barnett ’01, ’03, dedicated herself to providing opportunities for alumni in all stages of their career to increase their career development IQ. 4 Stony Brook University Alumni Association ALUMNI SERVED 3,510 223% Individual consultations: 906 Increase from last year: Attended workshops, webinars & events: 1,900 Alumni helped students and recent graduates: 704 </div>
