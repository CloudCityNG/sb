		<td>message A MESSAGE FROM ROBERT STAFFORD ’72, ’82 President, Stony Brook University Alumni Association As the Stony Brook University Alumni Association celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year, I’m delighted to reintroduce the Stony Brook University Alumni Association Annual Report, new for academic year 2014-2015. Thanks to you, we have so much to be proud of this year, including a tremendous increase in alumni engagement. Thousands of you are volunteering, nearly 4,000 of you are attending our alumni events, and more of you than ever are establishing connections within our impressive global network – now 158,000 alumni strong! Robert Stafford, ’72, ’82 President, Stony Brook University Alumni Association Our mission is to help you remain informed, engaged and proud of your alma mater. This year, we offered more ways to reconnect with Stony Brook than ever before. From a 50th Reunion Weekend featuring a Brook Heritage Society Induction Ceremony for those who have reached their 50th Anniversary, to our first ever 40 Under Forty alumni awards program to mini-reunions, tours, and talks at our annual Homecoming event – Wolfstock – our alumni have never been more engaged. There are also more perks to being part of the Stony Brook University Alumni Association than ever before. In 2015, we rolled out a lifelong learning portfolio, new discounts and benefits, access to the Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center, and new workshops, networking receptions and webinars to help with your career. Thanks to very generous alumni donors like you, we were also able to provide $33,600 in awards and scholarships for our deserving students. I’m sure that in reading this report, you’ll feel a renewed sense of pride and a curiosity about how you can become more involved. We cannot wait to see what the next year will bring and look forward to sharing the excitement with you. 2 Stony Brook University Alumni Association </td>

Afterward a record-setting crowd of 11,301 packed the stands at LaValle Stadium, and the stadium shook with excitement as fans cheered the Seawolves all the way into overtime during their match-up against the William and Mary Tribe. The festivities concluded with a thrilling fireworks display, making it a Homecoming to remember for all who came back to the Brook. Graduates from the five Health Sciences Center (HSC) Schools have been actively assisting nursing, medical, dental, social welfare and allied health students, including new mentoring programs to help nursing and medical students transition to their new professions. Many HSC graduates have been attending class and program reunions, and several class and family endowments have been established.
