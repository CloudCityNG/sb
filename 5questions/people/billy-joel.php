            <p>Author, social critic, and political activist Naomi Wolf is the author of eight books, including the New York Times bestsellers Vagina: A Cultural History, The Beauty Myth, The End of America and Give Me Liberty.</p>
            <p>In her work she seeks to raise awareness of the pervasive inequities that exist in society and politics. Wolf’s landmark international bestseller, The Beauty Myth, challenged the cosmetics industry and the marketing of unrealistic standards of beauty, launching a new wave of feminism in the early 1990s. The New York Times called it one of the most important books of the 20th century. Her most recent book, Vagina: A Cultural History, was released in 2012. The Times called it “a fiercely courageous portrait of female sexuality in the 21st century.”</p>
            <p>Her international journalism includes the investigative report “Guantánamo Bay: The Inside Story” for the Times of London, and as a columnist for Project Syndicate her articles have been published in India, Philippines, Egypt, and Lebanon. She’s a frequent blogger on the Huffington Post and writes cultural commentary for the Guardian, the Washington Post, and Harper’s Bazaar. Her TV appearances include Larry King Live, Meet the Press, the Joyce Behar Show, and the Colbert Report.</p>
            <p>A graduate of Yale and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Wolf was a consultant to Al Gore during his presidential campaign on women’s issues and social policy. She is co-founder of The Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership, an organization that teaches leadership to young women, and The American Freedom Campaign, a grassroots democracy movement in the United States whose mission is the defense of the Constitution and the rule of law.
