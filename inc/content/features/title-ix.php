            <h3>Stony Brook Makes Title IX Strides</span></h3>
            <div class="content col-2 col-2-left">
                <p>Stony Brook University is dedicated to protecting and helping our community. From developing targeted initiatives and offering resources to educating and informing our campus about sexual violence, discrimination and misconduct, Stony Brook remains committed to providing an environment that is safe and compassionate.</p>
                <h4>What Exactly is Title IX?</h4>
                <p><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">Title IX</a> is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in every educational program or activity that is federally funded. At Stony Brook, the law protects all students, faculty and staff from sexual discrimination, including all forms of sexual misconduct, harassment and violence.</p>
