            <h3>Stony Brook Makes Title IX Strides with Initiatives, <span class="nowrap">Training and Resources</span></h3>
            <div class="content col-2 col-2-left">
                <p>When it comes to Title IX, Stony Brook University staff is dedicated to protecting and assisting individuals on campus while developing initiatives and offering resources to keep our campus safe from sexual discrimination and misconduct.</p>
                <h4>What Exactly is Title IX?</h4>
                <p><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">Title IX</a> is a comprehensive federal law passed in 1972 that prohibits sexual discrimination in every educational program or activity that is federally funded.</p>
                <p>At Stony Brook, the law protects all students, faculty and staff from sexual discrimination, including all forms of sexual misconduct, harassment and violence.</p>
