                                <p>Stony Brook University was established in 1957 as a college for the preparation of secondary school teachers of mathematics and science. The first campus was located in Oyster Bay, Long Island, on the grounds of a former Gold Coast estate. In 1962, a new campus was built near the historic village of Stony Brook on land donated by local philanthropist Ward Melville. Part of the State University of New York system, the University has grown tremendously and is now recognized as one of the nation’s important centers of learning and scholarship — carrying out the mandate given by the State Board of Regents in 1960 to become a university that would “stand with the finest in the country.” The University campus lies about 60 miles east of Manhattan and 60 miles west of Montauk Point. It is only a short distance to the Atlantic beaches of the south shore and the vineyards of the East End. Situated on 1,039 acres on the north shore of Long Island, Stony Brook University is a four-season climate, tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound</p>

                                <p>The Simons Center for Geometry and Physics was started in 2007 by a gift from the James and Marilyn Simons Foundation. The Center's mission is to develop the interaction of geometry in the broadest sense with theoretical physics. The Stony Brook tradition is exemplified by the joint ITP-Math seminars initiated by Jim Simons and Frank Yang in the 1970s; these stimulated interest worldwide in the mathematics of gauge theories. <a class="arrow-after" href="http://www.scgp.stonybrook.edu/">Learn more</a></p>
