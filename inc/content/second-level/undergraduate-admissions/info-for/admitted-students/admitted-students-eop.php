                            <li>Stony Brook requires all full time students to have comprehensive health insurance, and provides a <a class="external-link" href="http://studentaffairs.stonybrook.edu/shs/" target="_blank">plan for purchase</a> by those who do not currently have such a plan. If you already have health insurance, you must apply for a health insurance waiver or you will be automatically billed for SB's plan. Once you register for classes, a fee for health insurance will be posted on your account. Log on to SOLAR and look for insurance waivers under "Student Financial Services" on the menu bar.</li>

                            <li>Just a few days before the start of classes you will participate in Experience Stony Brook (Part 2 of Orientation), where you will discover the vast resources and opportunities available to you as an SB student.
