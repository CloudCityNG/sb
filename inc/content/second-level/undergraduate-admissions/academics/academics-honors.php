                        <p>The University Scholars Program is a vibrant community of high-achieving students at Stony Brook. The program allows students to make connections with our world-class faculty, participate in numerous activities and obtain leadership and research opportunities on campus. The purpose is to create a community of learners focused around our three pillars of leadership, scholarship and service.</p>
                        <p>A four-year program, University Scholars is made up of some of the university’s most active student and community leaders. Freshmen residing on-campus have the option of living with other Scholars in their Quad and enrolling in a Scholars-only section of their first-year seminar course to help foster a greater sense of community.</p>

Scholars in the program are typically involved in outreach initiatives on campus and in the community-at-large and are frequently the recipients of prestigious awards such as the SUNY Chancellor’s Awards, Undergraduate Recognition Awards and Provost’s Awards for academic excellence. About ten percent of Scholars participate in the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) celebration every year. There are approximately 250 Scholars enrolled in the program each fall.</p>
                        <p>Admission: All high-achieving freshman applicants are automatically considered for the University Scholars program. You may request special consideration within Stony   Brook's Member Questions section of The Common Application.</p>
