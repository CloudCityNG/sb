            <div class="content application-details alert-message green clearfix">
                <p><strong>Message for Dowling College Students:</strong> Stony Brook is still accepting transfer applications for the fall semester. Students are encouraged to speak with an admissions counselor about our application requirements and transfer options. Please call (631) 632-6868 or e-mail <a class="email-link" href="mailto:enroll@stonybrook.edu">enroll@stonybrook.edu</a>. Please also examine our <a href="http://mobile.cc.stonybrook.edu/sb/undergraduate-admissions/academics/">academic programs of study</a> and <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/advising/_transferinfo/course_eqiv.html">course equivalencies database</a>.</p>

                <h4>Applying as a Transfer Student</h4>
                <p>For admission purposes, you are a transfer student if you have registered at a college or university after graduating from high school. Applicants are required to have performed well in a strong academic program, and typically will have completed at least 24 credits with a GPA of 3.0 or higher by the time they submit their application.</p>
                <p>If you have earned fewer than 24 credits at the time of application, your high school transcripts and SAT scores must also be submitted (only students with strong secondary school credentials will be considered for admission).</p>
                <p>Special consideration will be given to qualified graduates of university-parallel programs, i.e., A.A. and A.S. degree recipients from colleges within the State University of New York and City University of New York systems. Students are not, however, guaranteed admission into the program of their choice. Graduates of career-oriented programs (A.A.S. and A.O.S.) will be considered for admission on an individual basis and in competition with other transfer applicants.</p>
                <p>Applicants who do not specify a major on their application are considered for admission to the University rather than to a particular major. Transfer students with more than 56 credits must indicate a major on their application to be eligible for financial aid.</p>
                <p>Offers of admission are conditional, pending receipt of all official records showing successful completion of academic work in progress.</p>
