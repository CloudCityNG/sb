    <p>Christine graduated from Stony Brook University with a BA in Spanish Language and Literature (Go Seawolves!). She is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Higher Education Administration.</p>
    <p>Christine loves speaking with international students and their families, both when students visit the Stony Brook Campus and when she meets students during her travels. Christine's favorite part of her undergraduate experience was taking advantage of all the activities SBU has to offer-from playing in the university orchestra to joining club sports. She loves when students inquire about clubs and activities on campus, and is happy to help a student find something that matches their interests!</p>
