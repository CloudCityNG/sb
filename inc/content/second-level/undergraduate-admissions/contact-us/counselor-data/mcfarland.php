    <p>Having grown up locally, Katie feels a strong connection to Stony Brook. She left for 4 year period while she attended The University of New Hampshire and obtained her Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree. She returned &quot;home&quot; after graduating college in 2002 and has been working in the Undergraduate Admissions Office at Stony Brook ever since. She also received her Master&rsquo;s Degree from Stony Brook in 2007.</p>
    <p>Katie enjoys traveling and recruiting in New Jersey despite all the jug handles! She encourages students to visit campus. &quot;A visit can make all the difference; it allows a student to say whether or not they could call Stony Brook home for the next 4 years!&quot;</p>
