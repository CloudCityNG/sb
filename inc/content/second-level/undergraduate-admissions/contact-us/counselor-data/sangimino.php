  <p>Lauren attended C.W. Post, earning both her Bachelor&rsquo;s in Electronic Media and Master&rsquo;s in School Counseling. As the National Admissions Counselor at Stony Brook, Lauren travels across the country talking to high school students about Stony Brook. &ldquo;I love meeting people from different regions of U.S.,&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>Lauren constantly finds herself impressed with the variety of academic and social opportunities at Stony Brook University. She believes new students will also enjoy the many opportunities Long Island has to offer. Originally from Merrick, a nearby town on Long Island, she&rsquo;s still in love with how the Island has a little bit of everything, from famous beaches to easy access to New York City.</p>
  <p>She encourages prospective students to visit Stony Brook and see if they can picture themselves as college students here. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for a student to choose a school they love in a location where they would enjoy living,&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>When she's not working or involved in Admissions Counseling Associations, Lauren can frequently be found in her kitchen. An avid recreational chef, she&rsquo;s often inventing a new soup or whipping up a signature pasta dish.</p>
