    <p>Chris earned his Bachelor&rsquo;s in Communications from SUNY Geneseo and his Master's in College Counseling from Long Island University. He joined Stony Brook's Admissions Office in January 2005. Aside from his work in the Admissions office, Chris is very involved in campus life, serving as the public address announcer for the &quot;Spirit of Stony Brook&quot; marching band at Seawolves football games and teaching a freshman seminar for the University Scholars program every fall.</p>
    <p>Chris is also very active in several counseling associations; he will serve as the president of SUNYCAP in 2012, and has worked with NEACAC, NYSACAC, and the Connecticut School Counseling Association. He's a huge Mets fan and baseball card collector, and maintains a personal &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; in his office with signed cards from former Stony Brook athletes and coaches.</p>
    <p>For those interested in learning about what there is to do on campus, &ldquo;there's a wealth of opportunities, both academic and co-curricular, available to our students,&rdquo; Chris says. &ldquo;Stony Brook really rewards students who aren't afraid to get out of the room and make connections; go to a club meeting, to a football game, to an event at the Staller Center. Eat at every dining hall on campus. Set up study groups with your friends. Play Quidditch. Whatever! Just do it! I'm consistently amazed at the things our students accomplish.&quot;</p>
