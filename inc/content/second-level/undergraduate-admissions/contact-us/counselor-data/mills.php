    <p>Originally from New York City, Amanda moved out to Eastern Long Island to pursue her Bachelor&rsquo;s in English at Southampton College before beginning her career as an admissions officer. She has held various positions in admissions, including Director of Graduate Admissions at Southampton. She joined Stony Brook's Admissions Office in 2004, and has since earned her Master&rsquo;s in Liberal Studies from SBU.</p>
    <p>Amanda enjoys her travel and recruitment duties in Massachusetts, and notes that what she likes best about working in the Undergraduate Admissions area is that every few months we are doing something else. &ldquo;In the fall we recruit, in the winter we read applications, in the spring we host admitted student programs and meet with students,&rdquo; and she says, &ldquo;in the summer we host information sessions and plan for the next year.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>She advises prospective students to &ldquo;keep an open mind and not be too fixated on the degree, but enjoy the process. Take a variety of courses, try something new, and take advantage of all that you can in college. There is no right or wrong major; there is no right or wrong path. East student has an individual experience and educational journey, so do what you enjoy to the best of your ability. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.&rdquo;</p>
