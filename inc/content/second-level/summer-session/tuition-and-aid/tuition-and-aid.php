                <h4>Summer Eligibility Requirements</h4>
                <p>Only matriculated Stony Brook students may receive summer financial aid awards. Visiting students should check with the institution they attend during the academic year. Applicants for TAP, Stafford Loans, and PLUS Loans must enroll in summer session classes for a minimum of six (6) units. Undergraduate Federal Work Study applicants must be enrolled. Advanced graduate students engaged in full-time research must enroll in the appropriate course.</p>
                <p>Since TAP, Pell Grant, and the Stafford Loan programs have award limits which may not be exceeded, applicants should check with the Office of Student Financial Services to understand how summer awards may affect future eligibility.</p>
                <h4>Anticipated Aid</h4>
                <p>Awards that have been accepted but have not yet been disbursed to your University account are considered “anticipated aid.” Award estimates, stipends, Work-Study, and student reported awards are not recorded as anticipated aid. In addition, anticipated aid that is not disbursed after a period of time will expire and will no longer be taken into account against any outstanding University charges. Please note that if your aid has expired, it can still be disbursed to your account once the disbursement hold is resolved. To avoid potential late fees and registration blocks, it is important to promptly follow up on all required documents.</p>
                <h4>Summer TAP for Matriculated Undergraduates</h4>
                <p>Students may be eligible to receive TAP (Tuition Assistance Program) to assist with tuition costs associated with summer study.</p>
