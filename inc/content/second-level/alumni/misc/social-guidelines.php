                    <h4>Posting Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>The University Advancement Office at Stony Brook University welcomes interaction through comments, photos, discussions, and wall posts on its social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube). We consider these sites to be the equivalent of our website: an official face of the institution.</p>

                    <p>These guidelines address University Advancement’s official presence on social media sites, including the Stony Brook University Alumni Association Facebook page. University Advancement does not take responsibility for pages developed by others.</p>

                    <p>The contents of the Stony Brook Alumni Association Facebook wall, discussion board, photos, and other areas available for posts are a combination of content submitted by University Advancement personnel and Facebook members (e.g., students, alumni, staff, and friends). Only content added by official Facebook site administrators under the "Stony Brook University Alumni Association Facebook" page's name is considered official University content.</p>

                    <p>Content submitted by individuals does not in any way reflect the opinions or policies of Stony Brook University or the Stony Brook Alumni Association. Content and posts are bound by the Facebook Terms of Use and Code (https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) of Conduct and Stony Brook University’s policies. Content that has not been posted in an official capacity to Twitter, Instagram, and/or any additional social media sites but uses our hashtags (#Seawolvesforlife, #stonybrookalum, #sbualumjobs) or tags the handle @stonybrookalum is not considered official University content and is also not considered the responsibility of Stony Brook University Advancement or the Stony Brook Alumni Association. </p>

                    <p>Content submitted by individuals is not initially screened or evaluated during the submission process; however, Stony Brook University reserves the right, but is not obligated, to remove or block any and all content, posts, images, etc., that it deems inappropriate, commercial solicitations, factually erroneous/libelous, or otherwise completely off-topic at its discretion. Any unlawful and/or threatening content will be removed and reported to the site on which the content appeared.</p>

                    <p>We thank you in advance for your contributions and for your help in creating a safe and vibrant online community.</p>
